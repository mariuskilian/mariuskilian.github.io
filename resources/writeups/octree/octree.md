**Abstract â€”** We compare the trade-obetween reducing the memory footprint of ray tracing acceleration structures, by compressing the topology, against the increased computational resources and time needed to extract the resulting implicit data during ray traversal. We use an octree as an acceleration structure, as almost all information about its axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) is implicitly encoded, allowing for a very ecient compression. We compress the topology into a bit field requiring only one bit per node. To counteract expensive traversal on a single large bit field, we divide these bit fields into chunks, that serve as subtrees of the original tree. Furthermore, we compress a BVH using this same technique to compare the same trade-o, as it is the most common ray tracing acceleration structure in use. Additionally, we quantize the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) of the BVH by storing their relative position to a larger AABB, and saving that with less data. The compression techniques succeed in reducing the size of the topology significantly, but have shortcomings due to the overall design, which are reflected in the increased intersection times of the compressed acceleration structures, as opposed to their uncompressed counterparts.
